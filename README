Soccer Data Application for GrabCAD.
Made by Mike Borys.

This application uses the Play! framework, which can be found at 

https://www.playframework.com/

I've never actually used this framework before, I chose it based on my Java
experience. I'm not sure I'd use it again, to be honest, but it was a strong
learning experience that I'm glad I did.

After installing the play framework, you can run the program by using

>activator "run [PORT_NUMBER]"

to run the server and listen on a specific port. Note that you need quotes around
run and the port number.

Alternatively, you can run the command

>activator ui

to enter the Typesafe Activator UI, which will open a web browser and has
an interface to see the code, compile it, and run to localhost:9000.

I can be reached at mjborys81@gmail.com if you have any questions.

Thanks!
